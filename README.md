# VOX, YOUR PERSONAL TRANSCRIBER
Just basic usage of Whisper Api and child process in node js to call the python script that transcribes the audio files recorded to text and return it back the current open note in obsidian,
check out how to install or make your own plugin here [Obsidian Plugins Documentation](https://docs.obsidian.md/Plugins/Getting+started/Build+a+plugin)

**This Supports every language**

## Usage
1. Change all the paths in the main code to your desired ones
2. Get this script https://github.com/777leed/Vox/blob/main/cmdwhisper.py and specify the path to it in the main typescript file as well ( it contains my OpenAi token which is probably a bad idea but enjoy)
3. Install the packages in the script if you don't have them already.
4. that's all!, this is not user friendly I'm sorry. ( you can call the plugin in obsidian with the command CTRL+P and type "vox" )
